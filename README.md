# Mind in Flutter

There are two aims with this project:

1. I want to learn Flutter
2. I want to build a knowledge management app which meets my very picky requirements

I hope to be able to use it to gather ideas on different topics and build them over time.

Ideally, it should also be easy to mark entries for flash cards, for spaced repetition learning.

I am developing it "organically", using the embryonic state of the app to organize ideas on how to build it. (Also known as "dog fooding" your app ..)
